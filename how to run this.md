# Instructions for Running the Code

## Prerequisites
Ensure the system has Python 3.7.17 installed in addition to any global Python versions.

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Prepare the Environment**  
   - Inside the `code` folder, you will find data from an existing run. 
   - You have two options:
     - Run the `plot.py` script directly over the existing data to generate the Spearman and Jaccard coefficient plots.
     - **OR**:
       - Delete the `models` folder inside the `experiments` folder. This folder and its contents will be regenerated by the code.
       - Delete the images inside the `results` folder. These will also be regenerated during the process.

2. **Set up Python Environment**  
   - Navigate to the `code` folder within the `sds` repository:
     ```bash
     cd code
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment using Python 3.7:
     ```bash
     python3.7 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Execute the Main Script**  
   - Run the `sdsf.py` script using Python 3.7:
     ```bash
     python3.7 sdsf.py
     ```

5. **Generate Plots**  
   - After the execution completes, new folders and CSV files will be generated inside the `experiments` folder.
   - Run the `plot.py` script to generate the plots in the `results` folder:
     ```bash
     python3.7 plot.py
     ```

## Expected Outcome
- New files and folders will appear in the `experiments` folder.
- The `results` folder will contain updated Spearman and Jaccard coefficient plots.
